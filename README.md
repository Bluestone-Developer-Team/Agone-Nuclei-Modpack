# Agone Nuclei 

Agone Nuclei is a Minecraft modpack with a focus on global logistics and modern warfare. This modpack is primarily centered around 'HBM's NTM' but (will) include many changes in order to optimize it for challenging resource management to be more MMO ready. This project may not be as clean as it should be, but over time it should conform to standards.
